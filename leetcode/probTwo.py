# You start with an array A of size N. 
#Initially all elements of the array A are zero. 
#You will be given K positive integers. Let j be one of these integers,
# you have to add 1 to all A[i], where i â‰¥ j. Your task is to print the array A after all these K updates are done.
# Note: 1-based indexing is used everywhere in this question.
